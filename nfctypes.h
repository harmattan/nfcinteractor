/*!
  \brief Important enums that are shared between QML and C++.

  QML doesn't have direct enum support, therefore, the enums are
  exported from C++ to be able to reuse them in the QML world.
  This is the only possible approach currently, but works fine.
  One of the limitations is that when passing data between
  C++ and QML, it's generally passed as Integer and not as a
  real enum, loosing some type safety due to the need to cast
  it back to an enum.

      Some of the message types represent real NDEF record types,

      (e.g., MsgGeo). Some other types defined here are just
      templates used to pre-populate the editing UI with various
      individual records, and do not actually appear in the model
      (e.g., MsgAnnotatedUrl, which is added as a MsgUri and a MsgText).

      same MessageType, but different RecordContent - as these define
      different aspects of the message.

    /*!
      \brief Type of the content of an individual item in the model.

      The content defines what part of the whole message is defined by this
      record item. Usually, a complete NDEF record consists of multime
      NfcRecordItem instances, all of them having the same MessageType,
      but their individual content items defined by having a different
      RecordContent. For example, a Smart Poster MessageType always has a
      RecordHeader and a RecordUri. Optionally (= if added by the user),
      it can also have a RecordText, RecordTextLanguage, RecordSpAction, etc.

      Some of the RecordContent can occur in different MessageType s. A
      good example is the RecordText, which can be used as the title in all
      records that map to a Smart Poster, or also in an extra text NDEF record.
      Other RecordContent items are specific to a MessageType, for example the
      RecordSpAction is only used within a Smart Poster.

      The RecordContent tells the UI how to draw the item in the editing UI
      (e.g., as a text box, or a selection item). Additionally, it tells the
      NfcModelToNdef class what part of the NDEF record is defined by this
      NfcRecordItem.
