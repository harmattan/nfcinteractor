Nfc Interactor
==============
The Java ME-based NFC Interactor can write many different NFC Forum NDEF message formats to all supported tag formats, delete the existing message from a tag (by overwriting it with an empty message), read the contents of an NDEF-formatted tag and clone the message to other tags. The application checks the device for NFC availability.

The following message types are currently supported for writing:
- Smart Poster with URI, title*, action* and image* (* optional)
- URI record, automatically encoded with all defined URI abbreviations.
- Text record; the default English language / UTF-8 encoding can be adapted in the source code.
- SMS: stored as a URI record if it contains a number and body text, or as a Smart Poster if the optional title and action are selected as well.
- Annotated URL: NDEF message containing an URL and a text record. Similar to the Smart poster, but without the meta-record to save a few bytes.
- MIME record for PNG and GIF images; the image can be selected from provided samples.
- Geo record: URL record containing a link to coordinates specified by longitude and latitude. Can either be written in the "geo:" URI scheme (http://geouri.org/) or as a link to Ovi Maps (starts the Nokia Maps client on Symbian)
- Custom record: user-definable record type and payload.
- Combination tag format: creates a message consisting of two records:
  1. Custom record (for handling with a custom content handler plug-in) & 
  2. URL (e.g., a link to the Nokia Store to download the app including the content-handler plug-in).

A simple reading functionality shows basic information about the tag but doesn't parse the record's contents. For Smart Poster, URI and Text records, the type and its payload are shown on the screen. For all other message types, the format and name are shown.

Deleting a tag (over)writes the tag contents with an empty record. Cloning a tag first reads the NDEF message from a tag, and then writes the cached message to any number of additional tags. Note that cloning just copies the NDEF message, it does not alter the ID of the tags.

The app is made in a way so that it is ideal for quickly writing various messages to tags, or as a starting point for own development tests and NFC experiments.

Therefore, the structure of the application has to be modified to be suitable for a rich tag reader / writer app - e.g., the individual record handling should be externalized into separate classes, and the UI should be modularized for the different writing modes.

PREREQUISITES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Java ME basics.


IMPORTANT FILES/CLASSES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- NFCinteractor.java : includes the MIDlet handling and UI.
- NfcManager.java : encapsulates the NFC interaction.


KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The app is a flexible starting point for NDEF message experiments. For other usecases, you should extend the app to separate the MIDlet, the UI, the NFC interaction and the various NDEF message types into extra classes.


BUILD & INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preparations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The download includes a NetBeans 7 project, but you can also import the app with Eclipse Pulsar. If you choose NetBeans, make sure you download the full installation package. At install-time, select at least the Java ME target (including its required dependencies on standard Java SE development).

For compiling and testing, get the Symbian^3 SDK:
http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/571baaf2-042a-4662-9d43-a5a68eb42d9d/Symbian_3_SDK_v1_0_en.zip.html
Plus the NFC plug-in for the Symbian^3 SDK:
http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/fb8e0f5a-75db-4459-a82e-6eee9e569a90/NFC_Plug_in_Symbian_3_SDK.html

Alternatively, you can use the Series 40 Nokia 6212 NFC SDK from:
http://www.forum.nokia.com/Library/Tools_and_downloads/Archive.xhtml 

Make sure you have a Symbian phone with NFC support (C7-00: Symbian Anna firmware or newer) or one of the previous NFC capable Nokia Series 40 devices to test.

Build & installation instructions using NetBeans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open the NFCinteractor project
   File > Open Project, select the project directory.

2. Make sure you select the Symbian^3 / Series 40 Nokia 6212 NFC SDK as the target,
   especially in case NetBeans reports missing references.

3. Press the Build button to build the project and create the 
   NFCinteractor.jar / .jad installation files. 
   Install the application to the device using the Nokia Ovi Suite 
   or by using NetBean's built-in deployment functionalities.


COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- NetBeans 7.0 or Eclipse Pulsar
- Symbian^3 SDK with NFC plug-in
  or Series 40 Nokia 6212 NFC SDK

Tested on: 
- Nokia C7-00 with Symbian Anna and Belle
- Nokia 600 with Symbian Belle


CHANGE HISTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 Added feature to clone tags
6.0 Improved UI with instructions and slim popup-sytle operation mode list when in a write operation mode.
    Additional input field to specify text tag language from the UI.
5.3 Support for GEO URL records
    Support for Annotated URL messages
5.2 Selection of image to write, additional small GIF sample image.
5.1 New feature to write a combination tag type (custom record + URI record)
5.0 Refactoring to move NFC functionality into separate NfcManager class.
Checks for NFC support at application startup. If the Nokia C7 without NFC is detected, a firmware update is recommended.
4.0 Added support for sms records and custom records. Code improvements.
1.0 First version
