Nfc Interactor
http://www.nfcinteractor.com
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

View low level information about NFC tags and their contents, and write your own tags with a dynamic NDEF message editor UI.

Touch an NFC tag to analyze its format and its contents. Nfc Interactor parses and shows many different NDEF messages and extends the offering of Qt through reusable convenience classes for handling additional record types: Smart Poster, Mime/Image, vCard, SMS, Social Networks, Geo-Tags, Smart URI and custom records.

Compose your own NDEF messages by combining one or more NDEF records using the dynamic editor interface. Various templates assist you, allowing you to concentrate on the content instead of the format. While editing, Nfc Interactor will always show you the current size. Once your message is finalized, write it to as many tags as you like.

Nfc Interactor is written in Qt and works on Symbian Anna / Belle as well as on MeeGo Harmattan. As an open source example project, it also showcases the use of Qt Quick Components, as well as the integration of C++ with QML.


Note: this version of Nfc Interactor replaces the previous Java ME-based NFCinteractor. The new Qt-version is more powerful and introduces a wealth of new features, plus improved reading support. The Java ME-based project is still useful as a code example and has therefore been renamed to Nfc Creator and is available here: https://projects.developer.nokia.com/nfccreator . This Qt-based Nfc Interactor also succeeds the "Nfc Info" project, which was only capable of reading tags.


FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tag reading:
- Tag type (NFC Forum Tag Type 1, 2, 3, 4 and Mifare)
- Tag UID
- Tag version
- Tag memory size, static vs. dynamic memory (for tag types 1 + 2**)
- Lock bits and Capability Container access level (for static memory tag types 1 + 2**)
- NDEF message size
- List of all individual NDEF records
- Parses Smart Poster, URI, text, image and business card (vCard) records
- App is automatically launched for custom record with external RTD: "nokia.com:nfcinteractor"
- Stores parsed URI or text to the clipboard

Tag writing:
- Dynamic UI to create a message consisting of multiple NDEF records, and to add information to each record
- Help for all supported message types
- NDEF message size calculation
- Specialized editors for each message type:
  - Social Network record: enter the username and choose the network to create a link to follow you. Creates a URI or Smart Poster, depending on if you add an optional title.
  - Business card record: select the data to include from a wealth of available fields, and create your own business card based on the universal vCard standard. Integrates with the Qt Mobility Contacts APIs. Note: usually large tag size requirements.
  - Geo record: enter coordinates and select the Geo Tag type. Supports Geo URI (RFC 5870), Nokia Maps links and a generic redirection script that enables Geo tags on Symbian and MeeGo, hosted at nfcinteractor.com*. Integrates with the Qt Mobility Location APIs for the coordinates. Creates a URI or Smart Poster, depending on if you add an optional title.
  - App Store record: generate a download link to an app store. Creates a direct store link if one ID is specified, or a generic link using a platform detection script at nfcinteractor.com* if more app ids are specified. For Nokia, either specify a generic Nokia Store ID if it's the same for all platforms, or instead specify an own ID for Symbian, MeeGo Harmattan and if needed Series 40. Creates a URI or Smart Poster, depending on if you add an optional title.
  - SMS record: enter number and body to create a working SMS link, useful for example to request information services or for payment via SMS. Creates a URI or Smart Poster, depending on if you add an optional title.
  - Smart Posters: has to contain at least a URI, optionally an unlimited amount of titles in different languages, a recommended action and information about the linked content (size and MIME type).
  - URI records: automatically shortens URIs according to the specification to save tag space (e.g., won't save "http://www.", but encode that in a single byte).
  - Text records: set text and language.
  - Custom records: Choose the type name format and optionally add a type name and payload. Also useful for application autostart tags.

Easily reusable code for developers including:
- NDEF record classes for: Smart Poster, Mime/vCard (Business Cards), Mime/Image, Geo coordinates, App Store links, Social Networks (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Xing, vKontakte, Foursquare), SMS, Smart URI (depending on content requirements uses Smart Poster or URI to create the smallest possible message)
- Tag-specifc access to read the tag size and lock status (for Tag Types 1 + 2**)

Known bugs / issues (work-in-progress):
- Create settings screen to select folder for images
- Save & load settings
- Bring image functionalities to MeeGo
- Support stand-alone image record
- Support images in business cards

Ideas for future updates:
- Tap on tag contents in info view to open it in edit mode (also allows cloning tags)
- Save record contents to a file
- Write a contact from the address book
- Write vCalendar records
- Bluetooth pairing records
- Lock tags (type 1, 2**)
- Check composed record contents for errors according to specifications
- Use current location for geo tags (asynchronously updated UI)
- Birthday support for contacts (date picker UI)
- Image writing support (file selection UI)
- Geocoding (enter address, write coordinates to the tag - interactive UI)
- SNEP sending and receiving (through LLCP)
- Refactor record item defaults out of nfcrecordmodel.cpp
- Splash screen for Symbian
- Write empty message first, then full message, if writing fails? Increases stability on non-formatted tags.
- Support for writing AAR records (Android Application Record): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9016944/android-application-record-compatibility-with-pre-ics

* Disclaimer: The services hosted on nfcinteractor.com (e.g., the generic geo-tag redirection script) have no service or uptime guarantee. They are intended for testing purposes only and could be removed at any point. You should host the required server-side scripts on your own webserver for real-world deployment.
** MeeGo Harmattan currently does not allow tag type specific access through Qt APIs; therefore, it's not possible to access functionality not offered by Qt classes, such as getting tag specific information or locking tags.

SECURITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symbian: The application can be self-signed.

Harmattan: No special aegis manifest is required.


KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General: the Tag Image Cache stores all images in memory. Images found in tags
are usually very small, making this no issue at all. For special usage 
scenarios, this class might have to be extended to cache the images
on the disc instead.

Harmattan: In contrast to Symbian, Harmattan PR 1.0 does not provide
simultaneous tag read & write access. This has been fixed in PR 1.1, 
which is the firmware version required by this example.
For PR 1.0, the example would need to switch between those two modes.
See the earlier versions of Nfc Info or Nfc Corkboards for example code
if needed. This example has not been tested on PR 1.0.

Harmattan: if removing the tag while the app is interacting with it (reading
or writing), the Qt Mobility APIs might not emit the 'target lost' signal
on PR 1.1. This causes the app to keep the "writing..." animation active,
requiring the user to touch the tag again up to 2x. This behavior has
been fixed in PR 1.2.


BUILD & INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MeeGo Harmattan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The example will work out of the box with the Harmattan target 
of the Qt SDK 1.2. Make sure you have the latest firmware version
on your Nokia N9. The Nokia N950 doesn't support NFC.


Symbian
~~~~~~~
Compatible phones:
C7-00/Oro/Astound, 801T with Symbian Anna / Belle
Nokia 603, 700, 701, 808 PureView

Device Preparation
C7-00 with Symbian Anna: install using the Smart Installer.
For manual device preparation, additionally install Qt 4.7.4, Qt Mobility 1.2 and Qt Quick Components from the Qt SDK:
