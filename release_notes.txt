Nfc Interactor Professional
===========================
View low level information about NFC tags and their contents, and write your own tags with a dynamic NDEF message editor UI.

Shows all information about Near Field Communication (NFC) tags available through Qt Mobility APIs. It parses and shows the contents of NDEF messages and extends the offering of Qt through reusable convenience classes for handling additional record types: Smart Poster, Image and vCard. The app is also showcasing Qt Quick Components and works on Symbian and MeeGo Harmattan. 

When touching an Nfc tag, the application will show general information about the tag and parse the contents of the Ndef message. The contained records are presented on the screen in the form of a list. 

Parsing support is included for URI, Text, Smart Poster, Mime / Image and Mime / vCard records. Any images stored in the message are shown on the screen.

This tool is mainly aimed at developers. While Qt Mobility provides convenience classes for parsing Uri and Text records, this example adds further ready-made classes for working with Smart Poster, Mime / Image, Mime / vCard, SMS and Geo-records. These can easily be reused in any Nfc tag reading project.

Note for Symbian: The project requires Qt 4.7.4, Qt Mobility 1.2 and Qt Quick Components 1.1 to be present on your device. On the C7, Symbian Anna (or newer) is required to use this application, as it enables the NFC capabilities of the device. Please read the build & installation instructions for more details.

Known issues:
- MeeGo UI not up-to-date

Planned additional features for first release:
- Nokia Store link (specify content ID)

Ideas for future updates:
- Tap on tag contents in info view to open it in edit mode (also allows cloning tags)
- Save record contents to a file
- Write a contact from the address book
- Write vCalendar records
- Bluetooth pairing records
- Lock tags
- Check composed record contents for errors according to specifications
- Faster startup-time by loading application screens on demand
- App autostart on tag touch of nokia.com:nfcinteractor tags (external RTD)

IMPORTANT FILES/CLASSES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- nfcinfo.h : encapsulates NFC target detection and NDEF tag reading / writing.
- main.qml : Setup for the UI and the page using Qt Quick Components.
- NfcInfoPage.qml : Handles interaction with the NfcInfo class instance and
glues it to the QML user interface to show the information on the screen.
- ndefnfcsprecord.h : Convenience class for interacting with Nfc Forum 
Smart Poster records.
- ndefnfcmimevcardrecord.h : Convenience class for interacting with Mime / vCard
records. Supports parsing the versit documents stored on a tag to Qt Mobility's
QContact class, as well as converting QContacts to versit documents for writing
them to a tag.
- ndefnfcmimeimagerecord.h : Convenience class for interacting with any image 
mime type record where encoding and decoding support is provided by Qt.
- tagimagecache.h : Caches any images found on tags in memory, for retrieval
and display in the QML user interface.


SECURITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symbian: The application can be self-signed.

Harmattan: No special aegis manifest is required.


KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tag Image Cache stores all images in memory. Images found in tags
are usually very small, making this no issue at all. For special usage 
scenarios, this class might have to be extended to cache the images
on the disc instead.

Harmattan: In contrast to Symbian, Harmattan PR 1.0 does not provide
simultaneous tag read & write access. This has been fixed in PR 1.1, 
which is the firmware version required by this example.
For PR 1.0, the example would need to switch between those two modes.
See the earlier versions of Nfc Info or Nfc Corkboards for example code
if needed.


BUILD & INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MeeGo Harmattan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The example will work out of the box with the Harmattan target 
of the Qt SDK 1.1.4. Make sure you have the latest firmware version
on your Nokia N9. The Nokia N950 doesn't support NFC.


Symbian
~~~~~~~
Compatible devices:
C7-00/Oro/Astound with Symbian Anna/Belle,
Nokia 603, 700 and 701 (plus all upcoming NFC capable devices).

Device Preparation:
C7-00 with Symbian Anna: additionally install Qt 4.7.4, Qt Mobility 1.2 
and Qt Quick Components 1.1 from the Qt SDK:
C:\QtSDK\Symbian\sis\Symbian_Anna\Qt\4.7.4\Qt-4.7.403-for-Anna.sis
C:\QtSDK\Symbian\sis\Symbian_Anna\Qt\4.7.4\QtWebKit-4.8.1-for-Anna.sis
C:\QtSDK\Symbian\sis\Symbian_Anna\QtMobility\1.2.1\QtMobility-1.2.1-for-Anna.sis
C:\QtSDK\Symbian\sis\Symbian_Anna\QtQuickComponents\1.1\QtQuickComponents-1.1-for-Anna-Belle.sis

Symbian Belle: already includes Qt 4.7.4 and QtM 1.2 - you don't
need to install these. Only Qt Quick Components is required:
C:\QtSDK\Symbian\sis\Symbian_Anna\QtQuickComponents\1.1\QtQuickComponents-1.1-for-Anna-Belle.sis



Build & installation instructions using Qt SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open NfcInteractor.pro
   File > Open File or Project, select nfcinfo.pro.

2. Symbian: Select the 'Qt 4.7.4 for Symbian Anna" target
   (compatible to phones with Symbian Belle).
   MeeGo Harmattan: Select the MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan (Qt SDK) release target.

3. Press the Run button to build the project and to install it on the device.

Note: if switching between Symbian and MeeGo Harmattan builds, make sure to 
clean the project inbetween. Otherwise, specific differences in the meta-objects
might not get rebuilt.


COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Qt SDK 1.1.4 / Qt Creator 2.4
- QtMobility 1.2
- Qt 4.7.4
- Qt Quick Components 1.1

Tested on: 
- Nokia C7-00 with Symbian Anna Firmware and QtM 1.2

- Nokia N9 PR 1.1


CHANGE HISTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0 Renamed from previous "Nfc Info" name to "Nfc Master" due to the bigger
	scope of the new version that also supports writing.
	Tag write support with dynamic tag editor UI.
	Switched to platform specific Qt Quick Components.
	Other fixes and code improvements.
1.0 First version
