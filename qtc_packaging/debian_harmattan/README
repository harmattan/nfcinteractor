Nfc Interactor
-------------------------------------------------------------------

View low level information about NFC tags and their contents,
and write your own tags with a dynamic NDEF message editor UI.

When touching an NFC tag, the application shows general information
about the tag and parses the contents of contained NDEF messages.

Go to the write mode to compose your own tag contents, which can
consist of multiple NDEF records. Various templates help to format
the contents.

The app supports the following content: Smart Poster, URI, Text,
Geo, SMS, social networks, MIME/vCard (business cards), MIME/image, 
app store links, Windows LaunchApp, Android Application Record and
custom records.

Peer-to-peer support between NFC devices for sending messages through
the standardized SNEP protocol, or with raw LLCP socket connections.

This tool is made for enthusiasts and developers.
